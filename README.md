## Ah, You are finally awake.. 

Well, welcome to my Github profile, as it may be observed from my account name, I am an absolute rookie and I feel very cookie about the idea of Python + Linux romance.

  -I have started studying Python around August 2024 and quickly realized its power, flexibility and absurd simplicty. Its beautiful relationship with Linux made me to switch to Ubuntu shortly after having been able to write with confidence in Python. Now I am making my way to become a greybeard on the realm of Python and berserker on the realm of Linux.
  -I am highly interested in back-end development and networking.
  -I am not a big data nerd but I do believe in mathematical elegence, so everytime I try to script something I follow mathematics rather than everyday data-science related dogmas.
  -I triple check everything, which may be quite a problem if you want something from me and If you need it quickly. I am not a runner. I call it 'Holy Trinity' principle.
  -I love reading and discussing about mathematics, especially the concepts of "topology" and "game theory".

That's pretty much me at the moment and I will do my best to keep this profile updated and I would love to contribute in open source projects as needed and of course as I become more confident, and reliable, with my skills.
