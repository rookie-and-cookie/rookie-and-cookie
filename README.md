#### Ah, You are finally awake.. 

Well, welcome to my Github profile, as you may observe from my account name, I am an absolute rookie and I just like cookies(homemade preferred).

I have started studying Python and quickly realized its power, flexibility and absurd simplicty. Its beautiful relationship with Linux made me to switch to Ubuntu shortly after having been able to write with confidence in Python. Now I am making my way to become a greybeard on the realm of Python and berserker on the realm of Linux.

So far: 

  - Pyhton  [========  ] %80
  - C [=        ] %10
  - Pandas [====      ] %40
  - Django [==       ] %20
  - SQLAlchemy [=         ] %10
  - Flask [===       ] %30

I triple check everything, which may be quite a problem if you want something from me and If you need it quickly. I am not a speed-runner. I call it 'Holy Trinity' principle. Basically put : 'Existence', 'Uniqueness', 'Functionality'.

That's pretty much me at the moment and I will do my best to keep this profile updated and I would love to contribute in open source projects as needed and of course as I become more confident, and reliable, with my skills.
